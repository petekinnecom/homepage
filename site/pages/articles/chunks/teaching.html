<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
Immediately following undergrad, I entered a Master's in Teaching program at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.  Seven years later, I have experience teaching mathematics in middle school, high school, community college, university, and I've even tutored first and fifth graders.  All of these experiences have helped shape me into an excellent communicator, presenter, and conflict-resolver.   While I have enjoyed my time as a teacher, I am currently seeking a job that more directly challenges my technical and mathematical abilities.  
</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed a broad background in working with people of all different ages, cultures, backgrounds, and skill-levels.</li>
<li>Resolved over 12,923 (estimated) teenage, social conflicts while promoting positive working environment.</li>
<li>Experience holding difficult conversations with students and parents regarding grades, behavior, etc.</li>
<li>Handled and organized large amounts of paperwork in order to keep accurate records.</li>
<li>Multitasked like crazy.  For example, while helping Chloe with a problem, I'm writing down the next algebraic step, I'm watching Eric because it looks like he's about to throw something, I'm listening to Abbey and Mike behind me in case they go offtopic, I'm thinking about when we should move on to the next activity,  and my stomach is rumbling because I skipped lunch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taught 3-day class on Computers.  Final project had 20 students crowded around a monitor watching their AI-bots battle it out on a digital battlefield.</li>
<li>Won the Pauling Academy's first ever Freestyle Rap competition.</li>
<li>Developed close relationships with many students.</li>
<li>Taught students to play Sublime, Green Day, and Michael Jackson in my lunchtime music course.</li>
<li>Held board/card gaming sessions during lunchtime.</li>

</ul>
