<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
My first foray into realtime Java and netcode, Net_rain is inspired by one of my favorite arcade games "Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo".  Intended to be a tetris-like button masher, large quantities of falling bricks fill up your game lane while you try to remember which button combination does what.  The multiplayer aspect works flawlessly on a LAN, but struggles over the internet, mostly due to issues with firewalls and routers.  Net_Rain's rebirth as a single-player game for Android is in the works.

<h2>Highlights</h2>
