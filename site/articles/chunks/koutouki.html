<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
Began in summer 2006, Koutouki was my first major web development project.  Built entirely from the ground up, it was to be a debating forum for my friends.  An anonymous debate between two users would be held for three days while users voted for the side of their choice.  At the end of the debate, the user names were revealed and the debate was opened for comments by all.  
</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Javascript.</li>
<li>Compatible across browsers.</li>
<li>Secure user log-ins with MD5 hashed passwords.</li>
<li>User uploaded avatars.</li>
<li>Debates were searchable and sortable on various key properties.</li>
<li>Email (and birthday!) alerts.</li>
<li>Threaded, AJAX commenting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get a graphic designer to do the CSS/HTML</li>
<li>Eliminate unused features to simplify visual design and codebase</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, no active install remains.  To get an idea of what it looked like in use, check out its history on the Internet Archive.
