<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>
This website not only holds a small portfolio of my work, it also serves as a small demonstration of my abilities.  In order to fully experience the site, you will need to have an Android phone with my portfolio app installed.  (Sorry no iPhone version exists.)  To download and install the app, follow this link:

When you have the app installed and are ready to begin, follow the link below.<br/>
<a href='#' onclick='request("pre-pair")'>Begin the Super-Fun Portfolio Experience!</a>

If you do not have an Android phone or simply wish to visit a static version of the site, follow the link below.<br/>
