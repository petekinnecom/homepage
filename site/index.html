      <p>They're nihilists. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography. Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski. I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski. Dieter has been on the fringes of —well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'. Lady, I got buddies who died face-down in the mud so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!</p>

      <p>Thankie… Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head. Wal, I lost m'chain of thought here. But—aw hell, I done innerduced him enough. Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?</p>

      <p>Goodnight, sweet prince. That wasn't her toe. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing. Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing. I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski. A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.</p>

      <p>You're just looking for a handout like every other. Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski? No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. Near the In-and-Out Burger. I got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet. Are they gonna hurt us, Walter? Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. We've got a man down, Dude.</p>
