My first major project for Android, Transient is a sidescrolling, platform jumping game with a twist.  Written as a way for me to familiarize myself Android, Transient quickly broadened my scope of abilities following a workthrough of the books Core Java books.
</p>

<p>
The game itself has been gloriously received by my parents and close friends.  Also, one guy from Germany wrote me saying he thought it was cool.  It's a very simple concept, but the game may be too difficult. Download it and give it a shot.  But don't stop at level one. The game really gets going around level 7.

<h1>transient_2</h1>

<p>
Building off of my experience with creating <a data-input="page transient">transient_</a>, I began writing transient_2.  Unlike transient_, which only allowed for square shaped tiles, transient_2 will contain curved level pieces (yay, linear algebra!).  I also needed to be able to quickly create, edit, and test new tiles.  So, I began by writing a level editor.
</p>

<p>
Once I had a level editor, I implemented the physics and collision detection.  I also threw together an Android proof of concept to verify that the FPS on the phone would be high enough.
</p>

<p>
While I'm really proud of my work transient_2, I think the vision is too ambitious.  Recently I've been playing around with the <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a> javascript game engine.  With a community made level editor and a built in physics engine, I'd probably be able to spend more of my time focused on the game itself, rather than the supporting tools.

Sequenced is an Android app written as I was learning Android development. The app is a simple number puzzle game.  Although the project was a quick one-off, I was able to team up with a graphic designer to help with the artwork.

<p>
I've started a javascript rewrite, so that I can try my hand at deploying with PhoneGap to both iOS and Android.

This app was written in a hustle before a long, lonely car ride.  It hits up the J!-Archive to find an almost endless supply of trivia questions (ahem, answers. Sorry Alex.) The J-archive has no public API, so this app does some web-scraping and a touch of regexing to pull out the questions. It then both presents them in an activity view and passes them to Android's text-to-speech processor to be read outloud.
</p>

<p>
While the regular expressions get the job done, it would have been much easier to use a DOM parser and some css selectors.  Oh well.  I'll take "Live and Learn" for 600, Alex.
