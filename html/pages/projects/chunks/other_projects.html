Written for a Combinatorial Game Theory class I took in graduate school, this program was built to analyze a modified-rules version of Reversi.  While it does include some game tree analysis, most of the strategies are based on heuristic models.  You can play against a chosen strategy or simulate a tournament of strategies.
</p>

<p>
It can also do a deep analysis of the game by building a database of all possible moves.  Once finished, it can work backwards to "solve" the game.  Of course, the game tree explodes rather quickly, so it can only really solve up to a 4x4 board...

I wrote a ruby script to rename my photos in bulk.  It sets the filename to be the date/time stamp found in the EXIF data.  Just how I like it.

<p>
My first foray into realtime Java and netcode, net_rain is inspired by one of my favorite arcade games "Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo".  Intended to be a tetris-like button masher, large quantities of falling bricks fill up your game lane while you try to remember which button combination does what.
</p>

<p>
The multiplayer aspect works well LAN, but doesn't work over the intartubes.  I believe it has something to do with port-forwarding, firewalls, and shady governmental organizations always trying to keep me down.  But I could be wrong about the port-forwarding.
</p>

<p>
I still believe in the game.  It's just begging for a javascript rewrite.
