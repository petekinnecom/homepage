This site is a custom built, single page app built using <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>.  It's all javascript and static html, there is no backend. There are custom build steps for development and production.  And a <a href="https://github.com/petekinnecom/homepage/blob/master/script/deploy">super simple deploy command</a>.
</p>

<h3>the terminal:</h3>

<p>
All commands are run through the terminal, even navigation. It has a registry of commands, using regular expressions to find the correct handler. Each handler can operate synchronously or asynchronously.
</p>

<p>
There is no easy way to use css to create the "block caret" that's found in the terminal, so I built <a href="https://github.com/petekinnecom/homepage/tree/master/node_modules/app/terminal/input/prompt">my own input element</a>.  This does not work on mobile, because there is no way to use javascript to show the keyboard. I tried using hidden inputs to trick mobile browsers into showing the keyboard, but it gets ugly very quickly.
</p>

<h3>on page load:</h3>

<p>
Each "page" is saved as an html snippet (see the snippet driving this page <a href="https://github.com/petekinnecom/homepage/blob/master/html/pages/projects/chunks/homepage.html">here</a>).  When routed to "/pages/projects/homepage.html", the app will load the snippet and display it inside of the layout. I've built in two optimizations to this process:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
    The build step pre-renders all pages for better, faster, stronger page load.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    In order to speed up navigation, I built a "cache machine" to pre-fetch all snippets. (I wrote this bullet point just to say "cache machine" cause I'm proud of that name).
