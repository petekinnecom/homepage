<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
Building off my experience with creating Transient 1, I am completely revamping the game.  In order to appeal to more casual gamers, the movement of the ball will be controlled by accelerometers, level design will include more varied tilesets, and art will be co-produced with a graphic designer.  In production currently, I have began by building a desktop tile and level editor and tester.  The basic game structure has been already ported to Android; all classes and structures are fully compatible on the desktop and phone versions.
</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Written in Java using the Android SDK.</li>
<li>Level, tile, and user data stored in SQLite database.</li>
<li>Revamped physics and collision detection.  Uses physics, geometry, and linear algebra to create fluid movement over various geometrical shapes.</li>
<li>On the fly texture and collision vector adjustment using transformation matrices.</li>
<li>Level/Tile editor allows for graphic designer to import textures and test ideas quickly.</li>
<li>Realtime game loop uses Model, View, Controller structure.</li>
<li>Abstract structures allow easy addition of new tile-types.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Handle entity spawning for dynamic tiles (e.g. enemy creatures or powerups.</li>
<li>Data structure for moving, twisting walkways.</li>
<li>Speed and memory optimization for Android.</li>
<li>...much, much more....</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product</h2>

As Transient 2 is my current focus, this level editor is regularly undergoing significant changes.  Please read the included README before using!
