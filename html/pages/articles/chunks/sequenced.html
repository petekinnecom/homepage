<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
Sequenced is an Android app written as I worked through the book <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/eband/hello-android'>Hello, Android</a>. The app is a simple number puzzle game.  Although the project was written in one afternoon, I was able to team up with a graphic designer to help with the artwork.  He provided me mockups and .png's; all of the code is mine.  We are currently working together on Transient 2.
</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Written in Java using the Android SDK.</li>
<li>Worked with Java's font decoration system to dynamically create the number tiles.
<li>Pretty!  Yay!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>The gameboard needs to be size-adjustable.</li>
<li>Improve the drag & drop feel of placing tiles.</li>
<li>Implement a worldwide scoreboard on my webserver.</li>
<li>Clean up instructions and high scores.</li>
</ul>
