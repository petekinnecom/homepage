<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
Written for a Combinatorial Game Theory class I took in graduate school, this program was built to analyze a modified-rules version of Reversi.  While it does include some game tree analysis, most of the strategies are based on heuristic models.  Note: this program was not built for the public; it was built to help my partner and I analyse Reversi strategies.  
</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built using Java and SQLite.</li>
<li>Simple UI</li>
<li>Console for game and analysis information</li>
<li>User can play as either color against a strategy of his/her choice.</li>
<li>Able to build SQL databases of all game states (given enough time...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multi-thread the game tree analysis</li>
<li>Make game board auto-resize to fit window.</li>
<li>Introduce better game logic control and user messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Product & Code</h2>
