<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
As the son of an engineer, mathematics has always come naturally to me.  Excelling in Calculus 1 & 2 in high school, it wasn't until college that my abilities were really challenged.  As an undergrad, I learned that I have the frustrating inability to let go of a difficult mathematics question.  Although stressful at times, graduate school served to both pique my curiosity and satisfy my desire to understand.  I routinely dream up new theories and make sure to always have a puzzler in mind in the event I have to wait in line.
