<p>
I currently work as a developer at <a href="http://www.appfolio.com">AppFolio</a>.  I've made major contributions in three areas: Online Leases, new hire training, and commercial accounting features.
</p>

<p>
One of the first projects I worked on upon arriving was the Online Leases feature. This feature allows property managers to create templates of their lease, populate placeholder fields using tenant specific data, and have all parties sign the agreement online. 
</p>

<p>
As a company, AppFolio has been growing rapidly. With plans to double in size, the engineering department needed a more thorough onboarding process. I was able to come up with a scalable process that eased the burden on both the new hire and their teammates.

<p>
Most recently, I'm working on features around commercial accounting.

I recently won 3 out 4 categories in our 2015 Hack Day competition.
