I currently work as a developer at <a href="http://www.appfolio.com">AppFolio</a>.  I've made major contributions in three areas: online leases, commercial accounting features, and new hire training.  Though I spend most of my day hacking away on my team's project, I spearheaded a plan to help improve our onboarding process, and I continue to work with new-hires and mentors.

<p>
Oh yeah, and at our latest department-wide hack day, I won 3 of 4 categories for my "Contextual Help" project.  Boo-yah!
