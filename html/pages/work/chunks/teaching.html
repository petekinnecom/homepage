<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

<ul>
  <li>2005 - 2008: High School Mathematics</li>
  <li>2008 - 2010: Teaching Assistant, University of Montana</li>
  <li>2010 - 2012: Portland Community College</li>
</ul>

<p>
Immediately following undergrad, I entered a Master's in Teaching program at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. Within seven years, I had experience teaching mathematics in middle school, high school, community college, university.  I've tutored students from 5 to 50 years old.  All of these experiences have helped shape me into a communicator, presenter, and conflict-resolver.
