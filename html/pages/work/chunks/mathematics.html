I exited high school with credit for Calculus 1 & 2, and continued taking math in college.  I learned that I have the frustrating inability to let go of a difficult mathematics question.  My plans of being a Spanish major fell by the wayside as I realized solving math puzzles is more fun than writing essays.  I exited undergrad with a love for mathematics, and decided to become a teacher.

After a few years of teaching high school math, I decided to further my education by getting a Master's in Mathematics.  I studied Combinatorics and Graph Theory at the University of Montana.  My research covered K&ouml;nig-Egerv&aacute;ry graphs, a generalization of bipartite graphs.
