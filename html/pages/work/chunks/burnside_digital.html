<p>
I was originally hired as an intern as part of what would become the <a href="http://portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School</a>.  I was kept on as a Contract Developer until the company was sold.  In my time at Burnside Digital, I worked on a medical application and a movie community site.
</p>

<p>
The medical application was charting software that allowed doctors to create template charts and fill them in with a speech-to-text service.  The app was split into a Backbone.js frontend and a Rails 4 backend.  Working on a team of four developers, my major contribution was a drag-and-drop system for nesting sub-sections of the template.
</p>

<p>
During a redesign of the movie community site, I was put on a team with two designers.  I made any changes to the rails backend as needed, beefed up the test suite, managed the team's git workflow, and deployed releases.
